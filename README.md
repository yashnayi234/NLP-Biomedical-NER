# Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) Using Transformer-Based Models

## Overview
This project aims to perform **Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER)** by identifying and classifying entities like diseases and chemicals from unstructured biomedical text. This task plays a critical role in applications such as clinical decision support, drug discovery, and building biomedical knowledge bases. 

We leverage pre-trained transformer-based models, such as **BioBERT** and **BERT**, combined with sequence modeling techniques to improve accuracy and consistency in recognizing complex biomedical entities. The project is evaluated using the **BC5CDR** dataset, which provides annotations for two entity types: chemicals and diseases.

### Key Features:
- Utilizes state-of-the-art transformer models.
- Includes training, testing, and qualitative evaluations.
- Runs seamlessly on **Google Colab** with GPU acceleration.
- Supports standard metrics for comprehensive evaluation.

## How to Test the Models
### Evaluate on Test Set:
- Each notebook includes code to evaluate the model on the **BC5CDR** test set.

### Test on Sample Sentences:
- Provide custom sample sentences in the input cells of the notebooks. 
- The models will generate predictions for real-world performance testing.
